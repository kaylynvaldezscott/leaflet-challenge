Submitted by Kaylyn Valdez-Scott Date: 04-DEC-2023 Project Title: Module 15 JavaScript Mapping Challenge

Purpose of project is to import earthquake data from "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php", in order to create a visualization to see all earthquakes documented on the site. 

Using Leaflet, I created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
- The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
- Included are popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when each marker is clicked.
- Also included is a legend that will provide context to the markers in relation to the map data.
